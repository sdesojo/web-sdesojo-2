# Scientific Focus Areas
My research focuses on understanding behavioral inequalities across genders and diverse groups. 
In my work, I analyze large-scale data sets, including GPS traces from over 400,000 people, smartphone app usage, and online user-generated data. 
I combine methods across fields, from network analysis to event study approaches and matching techniques. 
My Ph.D. project aims to understand gender gaps in human mobility across countries, cities, and socio-economic groups by using causal inference methods to investigate the effects of household responsibilities, division of labor, and safety perceptions. -->
